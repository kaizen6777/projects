## VAPT Framework üõ°Ô∏è

This repository contains a **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** framework scripted in **Bash**. The tool automates network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation activities, making it easier for security professionals to conduct penetration tests.

### Features:
1. **Network Scanning**: Perform host scanning, TCP port scanning, and service version scanning using Nmap.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Detect vulnerabilities on remote and local systems, with options for scanning only exploitable vulnerabilities.
3. **Exploitation Toolkit**: A set of predefined exploits using Metasploit for Windows, Android, Linux, macOS, and web payload generation and exploitation.
4. **Customization**: Users can modify targets and select appropriate scans or exploits directly from the menu.

### Main Menu Options:
- **1. Network Scanning**: Includes host scanning, TCP port scanning, and service/version scanning.
- **2. Vulnerability Scanning**: Performs remote or local system scans using Nmap and additional vulnerability scripts.
- **3. Exploitation Toolkit**: Allows users to generate payloads and exploit various platforms (Windows, Android, Linux, macOS) using Metasploit.
- **4. Quit**: Exits the framework.

### How to Use the VAPT Script:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
